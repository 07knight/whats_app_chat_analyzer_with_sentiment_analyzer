04/10/2024, 1:13 pm - +91 98160 63052: Hey everyone,

I know we were all looking forward to our much-needed break and the plans we’d made together, only to find out that the holidays have been cancelled. But let's not let this decision take away from the memories we wanted to create. We've been working hard, and we deserve some time to relax and recharge together. 

Let's come together, united as a batch, and find a way to make this happen. If we all stand together and raise our voices, we might be able to convince the college to reconsider. After all, a break will only make us more productive and motivated when we return. 

Let's make this holiday happen! Who’s with me?
04/10/2024, 3:38 pm - +91 98160 63052: Dear First Year Faculty,

Please be informed that, as per the instructions, First Year classes will commence from Monday, 7th October, according to the CAMU timetable, except during exam hours: 09:30 to 11:35 in the morning and 13:35 to 15:25 in the afternoon. 

During these exam periods, lecture and tutorial classes will be held online, while lab sessions will take place offline at the scheduled lab.

Regards 

Hari Krishna

As discussed in the class, I will allow the students who have missed Quiz 1 to reattempt the same. The requiz (i.e., Quiz 1) will be held on 14th November, 2024 at 8 PM on online mode. I will share a link in LMS portal as well as in your WhatsApp group from where you can attempt the quiz. The duration of quiz will be 20 minutes which will be auto submitted when the time is over. The syllabus for Quiz 1 is Module 1 and Module 2. Please login using your Bennett email ID. Those who have already attempted Quiz 1 need not attempt it again.

After quiz 1, quiz 2 will be held on 14th November at 8:30 PM. The instructions for quiz 2 remain the same as above. Syllabus for quiz 2 is Module 4 (Solid waste management, Water and Wastewater Treatment, Air Quality). 

No further reattempts will be allowed. Hence, please attempt the quizzes.

Best wishes,

02/05/2025, 12:45 pm - Br: No ma'am everyone knew it as it was already told in unofficial group and I didn't got informed by any faculty. it's just students are talking about it.
02/05/2025, 12:45 pm - +91 96218 24756: Tune nhi batya unofficial mai
02/05/2025, 12:50 pm - +91 98216 53882: It is not her duty to inform about everything. Faculty definitely had informed in the class or the LMS. It is each student's responsibility to take care of what is happening in the class.

02/05/2025, 1:59 pm - +91 98216 53882: She is just reminding what I have instructed in this group. It is not her words. It is mine.
02/05/2025, 2:05 pm - +91 98216 53882: Rather than placing blame, it's more productive to focus on how you can make up for the missed quiz. Always direct your energy toward finding solutions instead of dwelling on the problem.
02/05/2025, 2:06 pm - Rudraksh Bhai: Respected ma'am, She's not above us, she doesn't have any authority over us to teach us. Whether it's your words or anyone else's.
02/05/2025, 2:21 pm - +91 98216 53882: I agree—we are all on the same level. Even I don’t have any authority to rule over you. However, I want to express something that’s been on my mind. From the beginning, I’ve observed that Dhanishka has always gone out of her way to support everyone, taking on complaints and responsibilities without ever expressing how overwhelmed she might be. Instead of being treated as a friend and equal, it often felt like she was seen more as someone expected to serve others. That’s not fair to her.
02/05/2025, 4:27 pm - Br: Please note attendance calculation is:

Dear All,
 
It has come to our attention that many students are reporting discrepancies in their admit cards. Upon investigation, we found that this issue is primarily occurring when admit cards are downloaded using mobile phones—particularly iPhones.
 
In such cases, older files (Admit Card pdf) such as the March admit card are being retained on the device, leading to confusion.
 
To avoid this issue, please kindly convey the students about the following:
 
•	Download the admit card using a computer system/laptop instead of a mobile phone.
OR
•	If it is must to use a phone, kindly ask to use Google Chrome to log in CAMU and download, instead of Safari.
 
This will ensure that the student accesses the correct admit card.
 
Thank you for your cooperation.

 
Thanks & Regards

Thank you.
17/07/2025, 4:18 pm - Br: Hi,
As per a just now telephonic conversation with the Finance team, students who have retained their scholarship (minimum 8.00 CGPA without round-off, no backlog, UFM, or DCS) may proceed by deducting the eligible scholarship amount while making the fee payment.

Please note, the scholarship is still under process by the Registrar’s Office, and the fee currently visible on the portal reflects the full amount. Relevant communication and timelines have already been shared in the official fee guidelines.

You are requested to make the fee payment positively by today, 17th July 2025. This applies to both students with scholarship retention and those whose scholarship has not yet been updated—they should pay the full amount as per current records.

If you're unsure about which fee component (e.g., tuition fee) the scholarship applies to, please confirm with the Finance Helpdesk.

For queries, you may:
📩 Email: finance@bennett.edu.in (cc: sakshi.khera@bennett.edu.in)
📞 Call: 9319993113 | 9319993114

25/07/2025, 11:31 am - +91 98216 53882: Hello My Dear Mentees,

Hope you had a refreshing vacation. Now that you’re stepping into your second year, things get real. This is where your future path starts to take shape.

This year is crucial for your career, and I want each of you to return to campus with a clear promise to yourself: stay focused, stay disciplined. I know your schedule gets hectic. That’s exactly why you need to stick to strong discipline, especially when it feels hard. That’s what makes the difference.

From now on, you need to start thinking seriously:
1. Do you want to go for higher studies? In India or abroad?
2. Or are you aiming for a job right after graduation?

Whatever you decide, make a roadmap. Think it through. And when you’re back, I will sit with each of you one-on-one to discuss how you can get there.

*I am genuinely proud to have you as my mentees.* *You have always shown dedication and respect, and I thank you for that.* Let’s carry that forward into this year.

Trust me, share your goals with me, and together, we will make it happen.

Welcome to Year Two. Let’s go!

As you know, the NPTEL Software Engineering exam for all second-year students is scheduled tomorrow (26/10/2025).

It is requested to all Software Engineering faculty members and faculties whose mentees are from the second year to kindly motivate your mentees and students to appear for the exam at their allotted exam centers.

If any student asks whether they can skip tomorrow’s exam or appear in the December end semester exam instead, please inform them that no such policy has been announced yet. They should therefore make sure to attend and give their best in tomorrow’s exam.

In case any student faces issues related to the NPTEL hall ticket, please forward their message to me personally. For any other concerns regarding tomorrow’s exam, kindly let me know immediately.

Thank you all for your support and cooperation.
